Privacy Policy

Effective Date: [Today’s Date]

Sticky Note Pads (“the App”) is a Miro application designed to help users create and place sticky notes within their Miro boards. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how the App handles your data.

1. No Data Collection  
The App does not collect, store, process, or transmit any personal data, including names, emails, Miro credentials, or usage analytics. All functionality operates entirely within Miro’s platform using its official SDK.

2. No Third-Party Access  
The App does not communicate with any third-party servers or external APIs. All interactions are limited to the Miro board on which the App is used.

3. Use of the Miro SDK  
The App uses the Miro Web SDK to create sticky notes on the user’s behalf within a board they have access to. Any permissions required are strictly for enabling this functionality (e.g., `boards:read` and `boards:write`).

4. No Cookies or Tracking  
The App does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any form of user analytics.

5. Data Ownership  
All data created or modified by the App (such as sticky notes) remains fully within your Miro account and is governed by Miro’s own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

6. Changes to this Policy  
If we change this policy, we will update the “Effective Date” above and make the new version available through the same public URL.

7. Contact  
If you have questions about this policy, please contact us through GitHub, the Miro developer forums, or the communication method listed on our support page.

This App is provided as-is, free of charge, with no data handling or storage.
